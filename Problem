This is a simple structure of two Orgs

1. You can go to Org1 -> chaincode -> college.js to check what function I have implemented.

2. Now if we go to API -> query.js on line 327 to 335 . You will see two functions 
   1. invokeChaincode and 2. postTransaction.
what is done, if you uncomment this function and run node query.js file, you will see we can add transaction 
and query also.


But what I want is to perform rich query, currently I have to pass the key of the data (e.g - STUDENT1)
and then I am getting the result, but if I neeed to search from branch - Computer Sc. How I will get all the results

It will be great if you can add a simple line of rich query with an example. Then I can proceed.
